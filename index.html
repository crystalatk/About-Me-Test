        <h1>Hi Everyone!</h1>
        <h2>My name is Crystal:)</h2>
        <h3>I am person who loves reading, hiking, gardening, and playing games with my family. I have a stereotypical family:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>a husband</li>
            <li>a daughter</li>
            <li>a son</li>
            <li>a dog</li>
            <li>a cat</li>
            <li>a hamster</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>They are all ridiculous. I have a Bachelor's degree in Fine Art and a Master's degree in Biology. For the last seven years, I have owned and run a pohotography business. Before that, I taught Math and Science to at-risk middle school and high school kids. I loved both of these jobs, but like everything in life, their season has passed and I am ready for a new adventure! Soon, I begin my training to become a computer programmer. Like all things in my life, I have really big projects imagined for myself already. Here is my first build!</h3>
